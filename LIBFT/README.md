## libft

This is an implementation of useful C library functions.
Some functions are not present in many C libraries, but prove themselves useful.
Instructions of the implementation can be found in libft.en.pdf file, located in the same directory.

## Getting Started

### Compiling

Run the following commands:

* To compile
	- `make`
* To remove objects:
	- `make clean`
* To remove objects and binary file (program):
	- `make fclean`
* To re-compile:
	- `make re`

### Execution
 To test the program, run included bash file:

 './test'

 tests can be changed or inspected in main.c
