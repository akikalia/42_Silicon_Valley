## 42_PROJECTS

This are some of the C projects I've worked on in 42 Silicon Valley.
42 provides multiple paths to choose from. One I chose is OS programming, 
so many of the projects here include implementations of famous system commands.
Please keep in mind that 42 limits the use of library functions, 
can only use implemented functions or something barebones, like malloc and read.
