	- `make re`

### Execution
 To test the program, run program as follows:

 './ft_ssl sha256'

 './ft_ssl sha256 -s "sample text here"'
 
 './ft_ssl sha256 -q -s "sample text here"'

 './ft_ssl sha224 -r -s "sample text here"'
 
 './ft_ssl md5 ~/_file_name_'

 or, run included bash file:

 './test.sh'
